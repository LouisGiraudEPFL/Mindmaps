# Mindmaps
Xmind Mindmaps for my courses @ EPFL

No guarantees about the correctness of the content of the notes. If you see a typo feel free to message me

The content of the notes is not mine, it comes from different courses at EPFL. I do not claim ownership of anything in there, it is
just my synthesis of these courses, and I publish them in case it helps some people.

To open the .xmind files, you need the Xmind software : https://xmind.app/download/?ref=googlepa&gad=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIi7bQ2ouT_wIVxex3Ch08VwGjEAAYASAAEgLap_D_BwE
The free version should be sufficient to consult and edit the notes
